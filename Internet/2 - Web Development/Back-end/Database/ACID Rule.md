1. **Atomicity (A):** Changes to the database should either happen together (as a complete unit) or none of them happen at all. It says you can't leave things half-done; it's all or nothing.
2. **Consistency (C):** The data in the database makes sense and follows the rules.
3. **Isolation (I):** Your changes are separate from what others might be doing. It's like having your own space to work on your data without interfering with others' work at the same time.
4. **Durability (D):** The changes made stay safe and won't disappear, even if something unexpected happens.

In a nutshell, the ACID rules are there to make sure every piece of data in the database and the operations (changes) on them make sense and are reliable. It's like having a set of rules to keep things organized and secure when you're playing with your data.
