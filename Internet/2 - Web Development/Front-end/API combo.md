In essence, "combo" in the context of APIs implies a collection or combination of API resources, functionalities, or services that work together to fulfill specific requirements or provide a broader set of capabilities.

While separate APIs can still work together to fulfill application requirements, they may not fully embody the concept of an API combo unless they are integrated or bundled in a more cohesive manner.
