A domain refers to a distinct subset of the internet under the control of a particular organization or individual that is identified by a unique domain name.

A domain name is structured in a hierarchy.
- top-level domain (TLD) or the extension that follows the domain name, such as .com, .org, .net, .gov, .edu, and country-specific ones like .uk, .us, .ca, etc. 
- second-level domain (SLD), which is typically the name of the organization, brand, or the purpose of the website. SLD + TLD (like `example.com`) is known as a "domain name".

When you type a domain name into browser, DNS servers take that domain name and translate it into the IP address of the server hosting that site, allowing your browser to load the website.

Domains v.s. [[Subnets]]
Both involve hierarchical, structured organization, but the purposes are distinct. 
- **Domains** focus on the accessibility of IP addresses by translating human-friendly domain names to IP addresses. 
- **Subnets**(subnetworks) focus on the efficiency and security of network management and IP address allocation by dividing a larger network into smaller, more manageable pieces.
