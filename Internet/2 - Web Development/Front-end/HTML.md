A markup language is to annotate the document that tells its structure and presentation, defining elements such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, and other elements. It is commonly used for creating and formatting documents on the web.

HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is used to structure content on the web, defining elements like headings, paragraphs, images, links, and more. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is often used in conjunction with HTML to control the presentation and layout of the content.

Other examples of markup languages include XML (eXtensible Markup Language), which is more general-purpose and used for data interchange between applications, and Markdown, a lightweight markup language often used for formatting plain text.
