  
YAML, which stands for **YAML Ain't Markup Language (originally Yet Another Markup Language)**, is a human-readable data serialization standard that can be used for all programming languages. It is commonly used for configuration files and in data storage (e.g., in databases) or transmission scenarios (e.g., APIs). YAML is designed to be easy for humans to read and write and for machines to parse and generate.

1. **Configuration Files**: e.g. Docker Compose (`docker-compose.yml`), Kubernetes resource definitions, and Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines like those defined in `.gitlab-ci.yml` for GitLab.
    
2. **Data Exchange**: Similar to JSON or XML. Its readability makes it a preferred choice for scenarios where humans need to directly edit or review the data.
    
3. **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: Tools like Ansible, which is used for automation and configuration management, use YAML to define tasks, making the automation scripts easy to read and write.

YAML files typically have a `.yml` or `.yaml` file extension, and they are widely supported across different programming languages and tools. Be cautious about spacing as it can lead to errors or misinterpretations of the data structure.
