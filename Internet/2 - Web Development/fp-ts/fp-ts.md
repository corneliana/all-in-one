A monad is like a conveyor belt efficiently moves items through a factory while providing control over how issues are dealt with, ensuring a smooth workflow.

TE.getOrElse expected a value of the same type as the left side of the `TaskEither`, which was an `Error`.

Conflict between runtime validation libraries like `io-ts` and TypeScript's static type system, especially when using `fp-ts` for optional values through its `Option` type.

A union type in TypeScript, such as `{ address: string; } | null`, is not the same as an `Option` type from `fp-ts`

The core of the problem is the need to harmonize TypeScript's approach to optional or nullable values with the `Option` model used by `fp-ts` for functional programming. By converting between these models appropriately, you can take advantage of the safety and expressiveness of `fp-ts` while maintaining TypeScript's type safety, effectively resolving the mismatch and leveraging the strengths of both approaches.


fp-ts indicates the type and validate it at compile time, i.e. statically, and io-ts validate the the type at run-time, i.e. dynamically.

While `fromNullable` in `fp-ts` and `optionFromNullable` in `io-ts` both deal with nullable values and use `Option` types, their primary contexts of use are different:

- `fp-ts` focuses on enabling functional programming patterns in TypeScript, converting values to `Option` types for safer and more expressive code.
- `io-ts` uses `optionFromNullable` to decode nullable fields into `Option` types during runtime validation, ensuring that optional and nullable data conforms to expected types and facilitating subsequent functional programming operations on this data.
