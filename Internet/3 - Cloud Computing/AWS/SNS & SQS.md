SNS is a fully managed pub/sub (publish/subscribe) messaging service, enabling publish messages to topics, which are logical channels or categories.

SQS is a fully managed message queuing service, providing a distributed queue for storing messages as they travel between different components of a system.

SNS facilitates the broadcasting of messages to multiple subscribers through topics, SQS enables the reliable and scalable queuing of messages between different components of a system, helping to decouple components and manage asynchronous communication. These services are often used together in AWS architectures to build scalable and resilient distributed applications.
