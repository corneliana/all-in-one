Provides temporary block-level storage for EC2 instances
**higher-performance hardware disk than EBS**

- Better I/O performance
- Lose storage if stopped(ephemeral)
- Good for buffer/cache/scratch data/temporary content
- Risk of data loss if hardware fails
- Backups and replication are your responsibility

You can run a database on an EC2 instance that uses an Instance Store, but you'll have a problem that the data will be lost if the EC2 instance is stopped (it can be restarted without problems). One solution is that you can set up a replication mechanism on another EC2 instance with an Instance Store to have a standby copy. Another solution is to set up backup mechanisms for your data. It's all up to you how you want to set up your architecture to validate your requirements. In this use case, it's around IOPS, so we have to choose an EC2 Instance Store.
