- Stop the instance (for data integrity)
- Build an AMI â€“ this will also create EBS snapshots
- Launch instances from other AMIs

- Golden AMI: an image that contains all your software installed and configured so that future EC2 instances can boot up quickly from that AMI.

AMIs are built for a specific AWS Region, they're unique for each AWS Region. You can't launch an EC2 instance using an AMI in another AWS Region, but you can copy the AMI to the target AWS Region and then use it to create your EC2 instances.
