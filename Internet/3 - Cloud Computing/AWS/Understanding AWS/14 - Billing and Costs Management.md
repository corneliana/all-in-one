- Use **AWS Budgets** for setting and tracking specific spending targets and receiving alerts.
- Use **AWS Cost Explorer** when you need detailed insights into your AWS spending and usage trends, want to analyze historical data, or need to forecast future costs based on your current usage patterns.
	- Choose an optimal Savings Plan (to lower prices on your bill)
	- Forecast usage up to 12 months based on previous usage
- Use the **AWS Billing and Cost Management Dashboard** for managing billing-related information and accessing billing reports.
- Use **Cost and Usage Reports** when you need access to raw, detailed data for deeper analysis, integration with third-party tools or systems, or custom reporting and analysis requirements that are not covered by other AWS cost management tools.

Cost Explorer is generally considered easier to use and more user-friendly compared to Cost and Usage Reports.

If your organization has multiple AWS accounts, then you can subscribe multiple AWS Accounts to AWS Shield Advanced by individually enabling it on each account using the AWS Management Console or API. You will pay the monthly fee once as long as the AWS accounts are all under a single consolidated billing, and you own all the AWS accounts and resources in those accounts.
