When an instance terminates, the value of the `DeleteOnTermination` attribute for each attached EBS volume determines whether to preserve or delete the volume. By default, the `DeleteOnTermination` attribute is set to True for the root volume and is set to False for all other volume types.

By default, you can terminate instance using the Amazon EC2 console, command-line interface, or API. To prevent instance from being accidentally terminated using Amazon EC2, you can enable termination protection for the instance. The `DisableApiTermination` attribute controls whether the instance can be terminated using the console, CLI, or API. This option cannot be used to control the delete status for the EBS volume when the instance terminates.

# EC2: Elastic Compute Cloud = Infrastructure as a Service
An Amazon EC2 instance is like a virtual computer/server running in the cloud, similar to CPU and RAM of a computer.

## Sizing & configuration options
- Operating System (OS): Linux, Windows or Mac OS
- How much compute power & cores (CPU)
- How much random-access memory (RAM)
- How much storage space:
	- Network-attached (EBS & EFS)
	- hardware (EC2 Instance Store)
- Network card: speed of the card, Public IP address
- Firewall rules: security group
- Bootstrap script (configure at first launch): EC2 User Data

## EC2 User Data
- It is possible to bootstrap our instances using an EC2 User data script.
- bootstrapping means launching commands when a machine starts
- That script is only run once at the instance first start
- EC2 user data is used to automate boot tasks such as:
	- Installing updates
	- Installing software
	- Downloading common files from the internet
	- Anything you can think of
- The EC2 User Data Script runs with the root user

## Hands-On:
- Launching an EC2 Instance running Linux
- We’ll be launching our first virtual server using the AWS Console
- We’ll get a first high-level approach to the various parameters
- We’ll see that our web server is launched using EC2 user data
- We’ll learn how to start / stop / terminate our instance.

## Instance Types
- General Purpose
	- Great for a diversity of workloads such as web servers or code repositories
	- Balance between:
		- Compute
		- Memory
		- Networking
- In the course, we will be using the t2.micro which is a General Purpose EC2 instance

- Compute Optimized
	- Great for compute-intensive tasks that require high performance processors:
		- Batch processing workloads
		- Media transcoding
		- High performance web servers
		- High performance computing (HPC)
		- Scientific modeling & machine learning
		- Dedicated gaming servers

- Memory Optimized
	- Fast performance for workloads that process large data sets in memory
	- Use cases:
		- High performance, relational/non-relational databases
		- Distributed web scale cache stores
		- In-memory databases optimized for BI (business intelligence)
		- Applications performing real-time processing of big unstructured data
	
- Storage Optimized
	- Great for storage-intensive tasks that require high, sequential read and write access to large data sets on local storage
	- Use cases:
		- High frequency online transaction processing (OLTP) systems
		- Relational & NoSQL databases
		- Cache for in-memory databases (for example, Redis)
		- Data warehousing applications
		- Distributed file systems

## Security Groups
- Security Groups are the fundamental of network security in AWS
- They control how traffic is allowed into or out of our EC2 Instances.
- Security groups only contain rules that can reference by IP or by security group
- Security groups are acting as a “firewall” on EC2 instances, regulating:
	- Access to Ports
	- Authorised IP ranges – IPv4 and IPv6
	- Control of inbound network (from other to the instance)
	- Control of outbound network (from the instance to other)
- Can be attached to multiple instances
- Locked down to a region / VPC combination
- Does live “outside” the EC2 – if traffic is blocked the EC2 instance won’t see it
- It’s good to maintain one separate security group for SSH access
- If your application is not accessible (time out), then it’s a security group issue
- If your application gives a “connection refused“ error, then it’s an application error or it’s not launched
- All inbound traffic is blocked by default
- All outbound traffic is authorised by default

## Classic ports
- 22 = SSH (Secure Shell) - log into a Linux instance
- 21 = FTP (File Transfer Protocol) – upload files into a file share
- 22 = SFTP (Secure File Transfer Protocol) – upload files using SSH
- 80 = HTTP – access unsecured websites
- 443 = HTTPS – access secured websites
- 3389 = RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) – log into a Windows instance

## SSH

## EC2 Instance Connect
- Connect to your EC2 instance within your browser
- No need to use your key file that was downloaded
- The “magic” is that a temporary key is uploaded onto EC2 by AWS
- Works only out-of-the-box with Amazon Linux 2
- Need to make sure the port 22 is still opened!

## Purchasing Options
- On-Demand: pay the full price for what you use at any time
	- Recommended for short-term and un-interrupted workloads, where you can't predict how the application will behave
- Reserved: 1-3 year for a discount
	- Reserved instance - long workloads
	- Convertible Reserved Instances – long workloads with flexible instances
- Saving plans: pay a certain amount to a certain type and region on long-term usage
	- Usage beyond EC2 Savings Plans is billed at the On-Demand price
	- Locked to a specific instance family & AWS region (e.g., M5 in us-east-1)
- Spot: the highest bidder pays, i.e. your max price > current spot price. Most cost-efficient
	- Useful for workloads that are resilient to failure
		- Batch jobs
		- Data analysis
		- Image processing
		- Any distributed workloads
		- Workloads with a flexible start and end time
	- Not suitable for critical jobs or databases
- Dedicated Hosts / Instance: EC2 instance capacity fully dedicated to your use
	- A physical server with EC2 instance capacity fully dedicated to your use
	- Allows you address compliance requirements and use your existing server-bound software licenses (per-socket, per-core, pe—VM software licenses)
	- Useful for software that have complicated licensing model (BYOL – Bring Your Own License)
	- Or for companies that have strong regulatory or compliance needs
- Capacity Reservations: Regional reserved instance + saving plans (pay full price for a period even you don't use it)
	- Reserve On-Demand instances capacity in a specific AZ for any duration
	- Suitable for short-term, uninterrupted workloads that needs to be in a specific AZ

## IP Address Charges
- **Address => IP: Public / Private / Elastic** 
	- Private v.s. Public IP(IPv4): whether the machine can be identified on the public network
	- **Elastic IPs: a fixed public IPv4 IP for the instance.** 
		- Efficient backup by remapping the address to another instance if failure occurs.
		- Try not use it as it often reflects poor architecture. Instead, use a random public IP and register a DNS name to it. Or, use a Load Balancer and don't use a public IP. In other words, a flexible, dynamic addressing system to the cloud-based system with scalability, resilience, and efficient traffic management.
	 - Elastic Network Interfaces (ENI): a virtual network card that gives EC2 instance access to the network.

## Other stuff
- **Organization / Orchestration => Placement Groups**: put the instances in
	- Cluster: in the same rack of the same AZ. => big data job, low latency and high network throughput.
	- Spread: across underlying hardware (max 7 instances per group per AZ)  => maximize high availability as each instance is isolated from failure from each other.
	- Partition: across many different partitions (which rely on different sets of racks) within an AZ. Scales to 100s of EC2 instances per group (Hadoop, Cassandra, Kafka)
	
- **Hibernate:** preserve in-memory(RAM) state so as to accelerate booting. Under the hood, the RAM state is written to a file in the root EBS volume which must be encrypted. Available for On-demand, Reserved and Spot instances, and can't be hibernated more than 60 days.


ElasticIP: static IP addresses assigned to instances or resources in VPC. They can be easily associated or disassociated with instances, providing flexibility in managing IP addresses.

Spot Instances are indeed **less stable but cheaper** compared to On-Demand Instances. 
- Spot instances take advantage of unused EC2 capacity in the AWS cloud at a significantly lower price than On-Demand rates. However, this cost saving comes with the trade-off of reduced stability; **your instances can be terminated by AWS with only a two-minute notice if the demand for capacity increases or if someone else is willing to pay more**. This makes **Spot Instances ideal for workloads that are tolerant of interruptions and do not require continuous availability.**

**A fleet of EC2 instances**: refers to a collection or group of EC2 instances managed as a single entity to serve a specific purpose or workload. This term is often used in cloud computing to describe the way multiple virtual servers (instances) are used together to handle applications and services.
