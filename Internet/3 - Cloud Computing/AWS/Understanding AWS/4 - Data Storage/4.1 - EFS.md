## EFS: Elastic File System
- **What is EFS? v.s EBS?**
	- Managed NFS (network file system) that can be mounted **on many EC2 in multi-AZ**
	- allow multiple EC2 instances to access the file system at the same time
	- use cases: content management, web serving, data sharing, wordpress.

- **Storage Classes**
	- Storage Tiers (lifecycle management feature â€“ move file after N days)
		- Standard: for frequently accessed files
		- Infrequent access (EFS-IA): cost to retrieve files, lower price to store. **Enable EFS-IA with a Lifecycle Policy**
	- Availability and durability
		- Standard: Multi-AZ, great for prod
		- One Zone: **One AZ, great for dev, backup enabled by default, compatible with IA (EFS One Zone-IA)**

NFS: Network File System, a distributed file system protocol that allows a user on a client computer to access files over a network as if they were stored locally on the client's own hard drive.
vs Google Drive
- serve similar purposes in providing file storage and access, but use different technologies and architectures. Google Drive is a cloud-based storage service with its own protocols, while NFS is a network file system protocol designed for sharing files over a local or wide area network. Google Drive is a cloud-based service designed for personal and collaborative file storage and sharing, while NFS is a network file system protocol primarily used for centralized file storage and sharing within traditional IT environments.
