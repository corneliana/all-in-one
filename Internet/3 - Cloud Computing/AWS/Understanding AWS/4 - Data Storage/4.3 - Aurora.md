**MySQL and PostgreSQL-compatible relational database** that offers the performance and availability of commercial-grade databases at little cost.
It is **fully managed** by AWS, meaning AWS handles administrative tasks such as provisioning, patching, and backups, allowing users to focus on apps rather than database management.

It achieves high performance by using a distributed architecture that separates compute and storage, allowing it to scale out horizontally across multiple nodes. It also provides instant scalability with auto-scaling capabilities, adjusting resources based on workload demand.

Compared to traditional relational database options like MySQL or PostgreSQL running on EC2 instances, Aurora offers **significantly higher performance, automatic failover, and continuous backup and replication across multiple Availability Zones, ensuring data durability and high availability.**

Up to 15 Aurora Read Replicas in a single Aurora DB Cluster.
