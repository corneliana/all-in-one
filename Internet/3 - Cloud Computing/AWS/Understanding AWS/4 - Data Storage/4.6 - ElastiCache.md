A fully managed, in-memory caching service. "elastic" refers to the service's ability to automatically scale resources based on demand, allowing apps to efficiently handle varying workloads. It provides managed **Redis** and **Memcached** solutions to help devs to easily deploy and scale caching infrastructure in the cloud.
- Redis: offers advanced features and **data structures**, suitable for a wide range of use cases
	- An open-source, in-memory data **structure** store that can be used as a database, cache, or message broker. It supports various data structures such as strings, hashes, lists, sets, and sorted sets, making it versatile for a wide range of use cases. 
	- Known for its **advanced features such as persistence, replication, pub/sub messaging, and built-in Lua scripting capabilities.**
	- Commonly used for caching frequently accessed data, session storage, real-time analytics, job queues, and more.
- Memcached: **focuses primarily on high-performance caching.**
	- Store data in memory as key-value pairs, allowing for fast retrieval of frequently accessed data.
	- A high-performance, distributed memory object caching system, designed to speed up dynamic web applications by alleviating database load and reducing latency.
	- Unlike Redis, Memcached is simpler in terms of functionality and data types supported. It primarily focuses on caching and does not offer persistence or advanced data structures.
	- Memcached is commonly used for caching database query results, HTML fragments, and API responses in web applications.
