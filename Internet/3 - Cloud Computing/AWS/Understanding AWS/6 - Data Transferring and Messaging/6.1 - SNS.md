### SNS: Simple Notification Service => pub/sub model
 The "town crier" for broadcasting messages or alerts, i.e. send messages to many receivers. SNS is a fully managed pub/sub (publish/subscribe) messaging service, enabling publish messages to topics, which are logical channels or categories.
- **Mechanism
	- Event producer => SNS topics <= receivers listen to SNS topic notifications
		- Producers: CloudWatch, Budgets, Lambda, ASG, S3, DynamoDB, CloudFormation(state changes), DMS(New Replic), RDS events
			- Topic publish
			- Direct Publish
- **Security
	- Encryption
		- In-flight: HTTPS
		- At-rest: KMS
		- Client-side
	- Access Controls: IAM
	- Access Policies: similar to S3
- **Ordering
	- FIFO
- **Message filtering using JSON policy**
	- SNS => filtering policy => different queues for corresponding messages
