## IAM Best Practices – General
- Never use Root Credentials, enable MFA for Root Account
- Grant Least Privilege
	- Each Group / User / Role should only have the minimum level of permission it needs
	- Never grant a policy with * access to a service
	- Monitor API calls made by a user in CloudTrail (especially Denied ones)
- Never ever ever store IAM key credentials on any machine but a personal computer or on-premise server
- On premise server best practice is to call STS to obtain temporary security credentials

## IAM Best Practices – IAM Roles
- The following services should their own roles
	- EC2 machines
	- Lambda functions
	- ECS Tasks (ECS_ENABLE_TASK_IAM_ROLE=true)
	- CodeBuild
- Create a least-privileged role for any service that requires it
- Create a role per application / lambda function (do not reuse roles)

## IAM Best Practices – Cross Account Access
- Define an IAM Role for another account to access
- Define which accounts can access this IAM Role
- Use AWS STS (Security Token Service) to retrieve credentials and impersonate the IAM Role you have access to (AssumeRole API)
- Temporary credentials can be valid between **15 minutes to 1 hour**

## Advanced IAM - Authorization Model Evaluation of Policies, simplified
1. If there’s an explicit DENY, end decision and DENY
2. If there’s an ALLOW, end decision with ALLOW
3. Else DENY

## IAM Policies & S3 Bucket Policies
- IAM Policies are attached to users, roles, groups
- S3 Bucket Policies are attached to buckets
- When evaluating if an IAM Principal can perform an operation X on a bucket, the union of its assigned IAM Policies and S3 Bucket Policies will be evaluated.
	- IAM Policy + S3 Bucket Policy = Total Policy Evaluated

### Example 1
- IAM Role attached to EC2 instance, authorizes RW to “my_bucket”
- No S3 Bucket Policy attached
- => EC2 instance can read and write to “my_bucket”

### Example 2
- IAM Role attached to EC2 instance, authorizes RW to “my_bucket”
- S3 Bucket Policy attached, explicit deny to the IAM Role
- => EC2 instance cannot read and write to “my_bucket”

### Example 3
- IAM Role attached to EC2 instance, no S3 bucket permissions
- S3 Bucket Policy attached, explicit RW allow to the IAM Role
- => EC2 instance can read and write to “my_bucket”

### Example 4
- IAM Role attached to EC2 instance, explicit deny S3 bucket permissions
- S3 Bucket Policy attached, explicit RW allow to the IAM Role
- => EC2 instance cannot read and write to “my_bucket”

## Dynamic Policies with IAM
- How do you assign each user a /home/<user> folder in an S3 bucket?
- Option 1:
	- Create an IAM policy allowing georges to have access to /home/georges
	- Create an IAM policy allowing sarah to have access to /home/sarah
	- Create an IAM policy allowing matt to have access to /home/matt
	- … One policy per user!
	- This doesn’t scale

- Option 2:
	- **Create one dynamic policy with IAM**
	- Leverage the special policy variable ${aws:username}
```json
{
	"Sid": "AllowAllS3ActionsInUserFolder",
	"Action": ["s3:*],
	"Effect": "Allow",
	"Resource": ["arn:aws:s3:::my-company/home/${ws:username}/*"]
}
```


## Inline vs Managed Policies
- AWS Managed Policy
	- Maintained by AWS
	- Good for power users and administrators
	- Updated in case of new services / new APIs

- Customer Managed Policy
	- Best Practice, re-usable, can be applied to many principals
	- Version Controlled + rollback, central change management

- Inline
	- **Strict one-to-one relationship between policy and principal**
	- Policy is deleted if you delete the IAM principal

## Granting a User Permissions to Pass a Role to an AWS Service
- To configure many AWS services, you must pass an IAM role to the service (this happens only once during setup)
- The service will later assume the role and perform actions
- Example of passing a role:
	- To an EC2 instance
	- To a Lambda function
	- To an ECS task
	- To CodePipeline to allow it to invoke other services
- For this, you need the IAM permission ***iam:PassRole***
- It often comes with *iam:GetRole* to view the role being passed

## Can a role be passed to any service?
- No: Roles can only be passed to **what their trust allows**
- A _trust policy_ for the role that allows the service to assume the role

## What is Microsoft **Active Directory (AD)**?
- Found on any Windows Server with AD Domain Services
- Database of objects: User Accounts, Computers, Printers, File Shares, Security Groups
- **Centralized security management, create account, assign permissions**
- Objects are organized in trees
- A group of trees is a forest

### Types
- Simple AD
	- AD-compatible managed directory on AWS
	- Cannot be joined with on-premise AD
- AD Connector
	- Directory Gateway (proxy) to redirect to on-premise AD, supports MFA
	- Users are managed on the on-premise AD
- AWS Managed Microsoft AD
	- Create your own AD in AWS, manage users locally, supports MFA
	- **Establish “trust” connections with your on-premise AD**
