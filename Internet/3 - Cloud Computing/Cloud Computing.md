Cloud computing represents the shift from local or on-premises hardware and software to services delivered over the Internet. It enables scalable, on-demand access to computing resources like servers, storage, databases, networking, software, and analytics. Cloud services offer flexibility, efficiency, and cost savings, transforming how businesses operate and how services are delivered to consumers.

- **Service Models:** IaaS, PaaS, SaaS – each providing different levels of control, flexibility, and management.
	- **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS):** Basics of AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud Platform.
	- **Platform as a Service (PaaS):** Understanding platforms like Heroku, Firebase.
	- **Software as a Service (SaaS):** Leveraging cloud-based applications.
- **Cloud Providers:** AWS, Google Cloud, Azure – platforms offering a range of services for computing, storage, and networking.
- **Virtualization:** The technology that powers cloud computing, allowing multiple virtual machines to run on a single physical machine.
- **Cloud-native Technologies:** Containers (e.g., Docker), orchestration (e.g., Kubernetes), and microservices architecture.


[[Infrastructure as Code (IaC)]] produces machine-readable definition files to manage and provision computing infrastructure, allowing for the automation and scaling of infrastructure in a repeatable and consistent manner.
- **IaaS provides the raw materials** (like computing resources: servers, storage, networking) you need to build your infrastructure.
- **IaC is the blueprint and automated process** that assembles those materials into a functioning infrastructure according to your specifications.
