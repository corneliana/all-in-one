Infrastructure as Code (IaC), a practice or methodology used within cloud computing service models, produces machine-readable definition files to manage and provision computing infrastructure, allowing for the automation and scaling of infrastructure in a repeatable and consistent manner.

Key characteristics of Infrastructure as Code include:

1. **Automation:** IaC automates the provisioning of infrastructure, making the process faster, more repeatable, and less prone to human error compared to manual setups.

2. **Version Control:** IaC scripts are typically stored in version control systems (e.g., Git). This allows teams to track changes, roll back to previous versions, and collaborate effectively.

3. **Declarative Syntax:** IaC can be implemented in two ways: declarative (specifying the desired state of the infrastructure without detailing how to achieve it) and imperative (specifying the exact commands or steps to achieve the desired state).

4. **Consistency / Portability**: With IaC, environments are consistent and you can use the same scripts to provision infrastructure so as to reduce bugs and outages and the risk of configuration drift.

5. **Scalability:** With IaC, it becomes easier to scale infrastructure up or down based on demand. This is especially important in cloud computing environments where resources can be dynamically provisioned.

6. **Idempotency:** IaC scripts are designed to be idempotent, meaning that applying the same script multiple times should result in the same outcome as applying it once. This is important for repeatability and consistency.

7. **Integration with DevOps Practices**: IaC fits seamlessly into DevOps practices, which are widely adopted in cloud computing for continuous integration (CI) and continuous deployment (CD). IaC allows infrastructure changes to be versioned, reviewed, and deployed in the same way as application code, improving collaboration and speed.
