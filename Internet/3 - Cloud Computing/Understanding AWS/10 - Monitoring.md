- **CloudWatch v.s. CloudTrail v.s. Config**
	- CloudWatch  
		- Performance monitoring (metrics, CPU, network, etc...) & dashboards
		- Events & Alerting  
		- Log Aggregation & Analysis
	- CloudTrail  
		- Record **a history of AWS API calls** made within your Account by everyone
			- Use the CloudTrail Console to view the last 90 days of recorded API activity. For events older than 90 days, use Athena to analyze CloudTrail logs stored in S3.
		- Can define trails for specific resources  
		- Global Service
	- Config
		- Record configuration changes
		- Evaluate resources against compliance rules
		- Get timeline of changes and compliance

- **For an Elastic Load Balancer**
	- CloudWatch:  
		- Monitoring Incoming connections metric
		- Visualize error codes as % over time  
		- Make a dashboard to get an idea of your load balancer performance
	- Config:  
		- Track security group rules for the Load Balancer  
		- Track configuration changes for the Load Balancer  
		- Ensure an SSL certificate is always assigned to the Load Balancer (compliance)
	- CloudTrail:  
		- Track who made any changes to the Load Balancer with API calls

## Config
- What is Config?
	- Assess, audit, and evaluate the compliances and configurations of the AWS resources.
	- Questions that can be solved by AWS Config:  
		- Is there unrestricted SSH access to my security groups?
		- Do my buckets have any public access?  
		- How has my ALB configuration changed over time?
	- You can receive alerts (SNS notifications) for any changes  
	- AWS Config is a per-region service  
	- Can be aggregated across regions and accounts  
	- Possibility of storing the configuration data into S3 (analyzed by Athena)

- Config rules
	- Creation
		- AWS managed rules
		- Customized rules
		- AWS Config Rules does not prevent actions from happening (no deny)
		- Pricing: no free tier, $0.003 per configuration item recorded per region, $0.001 per config rule evaluation per region
	- Remediations of non-compliant resources using SSM/custom Automation docs
		- Tip: can create custom Automation Documents that invokes Lambda function
		- Can set Remediation Retries if resource still non-compliant after auto-remediation
	- Notifications
		- Use EventBridge to trigger notifications when AWS resources are non- compliant
		- Ability to send configuration changes and compliance state notifications to SNS (all events â€“ use SNS Filtering or filter at client-side)
