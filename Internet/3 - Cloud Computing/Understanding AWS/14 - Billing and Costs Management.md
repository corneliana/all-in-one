- Use **AWS Budgets** for setting and tracking specific spending targets and receiving alerts.
- Use **AWS Cost Explorer** when you need detailed insights into your AWS spending and usage trends, want to analyze historical data, or need to forecast future costs based on your current usage patterns.
- Use the **AWS Billing and Cost Management Dashboard** for managing billing-related information and accessing billing reports.
- Use **Cost and Usage Reports** when you need access to raw, detailed data for deeper analysis, integration with third-party tools or systems, or custom reporting and analysis requirements that are not covered by other AWS cost management tools.

Cost Explorer is generally considered easier to use and more user-friendly compared to Cost and Usage Reports.
