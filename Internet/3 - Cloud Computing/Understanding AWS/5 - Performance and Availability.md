## CloudFront: AWS's Content Delivery Network (CDN)

Edge Locations
Edge Locations are strategically distributed around the world, often located in or near major cities and Internet exchange points.

**Edge Locations are optimized for fast content delivery. Why?**
- They leverage Amazon's highly redundant and low-latency network infrastructure, allowing for efficient data transfer. 
- Edge Locations cache frequently accessed content, further reducing latency for subsequent requests.
