## VPC peering

VPC peering is a networking connection between two Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs) that can route traffic between them using private IPv4 addresses or IPv6 addresses. It establishes a direct network link between two separate cloud environments so that they can communicate securely and efficiently without passing through the public internet in a way that 
- simplifies network architecture
- enhances security
- reduces costs
- provides flexibility 
in how resources and applications are deployed and managed across the cloud.

The term "peering" traditionally comes from the concept of "network peering," where two internet networks connect and exchange traffic directly between them, rather than routing traffic through the internet or a third party. 

The term "peering" encapsulates the idea of two separate network entities connecting directly to each other in a way that is mutually beneficial, equal, and direct.
