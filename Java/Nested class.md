- Nested Classes (General Concept): Nested classes are classes defined within other classes. They help in organizing code more logically and provide better encapsulation.
- Types of Nested Classes: a. Inner Classes (Non-static Nested Classes) b. Static Nested Classes c. Local Classes (defined in a method) d. Anonymous Classes

1. Inner Class (Non-static Nested Class):
    - Has access to all members of the enclosing class, even private ones.
    - Is associated with an instance of the enclosing class.
    - Use when you need to access instance members of the outer class.Example use case: Implementing a custom iterator for a collection class.
2. Static Nested Class:
    - Cannot access non-static members of the outer class directly.
    - Can be instantiated without an instance of the outer class.
    - Use when the nested class doesn't need access to instance members of the outer class.Example use case: Helper classes that are logically part of a larger class but don't need access to its instance members.
3. Local Class:
    - Defined within a method.
    - Can access all members of the enclosing class and local variables (if effectively final).
    - Use when you need a class for a very specific, localized purpose.Example use case: Implementing a comparator for a one-time sorting operation.
4. Anonymous Class:
    - A local class without a name.
    - Declared and instantiated in a single expression.
    - Can implement an interface or extend a class.
    - Use for one-time use classes, often for event handlers or callbacks.Example use case: Creating a quick implementation of a listener interface.

Why use nested classes?

1. Encapsulation: They provide a way to logically group classes that are only used in one place, increasing encapsulation.
2. Readability and Maintainability: They keep related code together, making the code more readable and maintainable.
3. Access to Private Members: Inner classes can access private members of the outer class, which can be useful in certain designs.
4. Reduced Code Complexity: They can make your code less cluttered and more organized.

When to use each type:

- Inner Class: When you need access to instance members of the outer class and the class is closely tied to the outer class.
- Static Nested Class: When you don't need access to instance members of the outer class, but the class is logically part of the outer class.
- Local Class: When you need a class for a very specific purpose within a single method.
- Anonymous Class: When you need a quick, one-time implementation of an interface or abstract class.

Nested classes provide a powerful way to organize your code, increase encapsulation, and create more readable and maintainable Java programs. They allow you to group related code together and provide different levels of access and functionality depending on your specific needs.
