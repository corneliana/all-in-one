In computing, "state" refers to the current condition or status of a system, application, or process at a specific point in time. Like a screenshot?

1. **Stateful Application**:
    - Maintains info about the current state of interactions with a user or other systems.
    - Relies on storing session data or context info about each user session or transaction.
    - Requires persistent storage mechanisms to maintain session state between requests.
    - Examples: traditional web applications that use sessions to track user login status, shopping cart contents, or form input across multiple pages.
2. **Stateless Application**:
    - Does not store session data or context information between requests.
    - Each request is processed independently without relying on info from previous requests.
    - Treat each request as a self-contained unit of work and do not maintain user or session state on the server side.
    - Often use techniques like JWT (JSON Web Tokens) or OAuth for authentication and authorization, allowing clients to carry their state with each request.
    - Examples: RESTful APIs, microservices architectures, and serverless functions.

Stateless apps are often preferred for scalability, resilience, and ease of deployment, especially in distributed and cloud-native environments. 
Stateful apps might be necessary for scenarios requiring complex session management or data consistency across multiple interactions.
