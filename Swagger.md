Goal:
- Specification of the API's endpoints, I/O payload and the schema
- Validate and deploy the schema => Swagger Codegen: generate client libraries or server stubs so as to bridge between design and implementation
- test?

An API instruction <= yaml / json file containing the RESTful endpoints and schema
- handwritten? No!
- can it be generated based on the routes?
- how can I use it? Just drop it in the https://editor.swagger.io/? Any other ways?
