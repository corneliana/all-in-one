Build a tree roadmap tree, that you can edit and put your knowledge map tree. It is like a note-taking system. Remember the tree we drew when we were little.

Also a book reading and taking notes system, following `How to read a book` pattern. We scrawl public book sources online, and automatically generate the outline and summarize the book's content. Maybe we should use AI here haha.

And how can I forget my todo list.

Also write a fp-ts program. I don't know what to write, but let's do it.
