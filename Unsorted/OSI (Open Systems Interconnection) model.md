1. **Physical Layer (OSI Layer 1)**:
    - The physical connection between devices and the transmission of raw data over physical mediums like cables or wireless signals.
2. **Data Link Layer (OSI Layer 2)**:
    - The communication between devices on the same network segment, dealing with MAC addresses and local network topology.
3. **Network Layer (OSI Layer 3)**:
    - Route packets between different networks, using IP addresses for addressing and routing.
4. **Transport Layer (OSI Layer 4)**:
    - End-to-end communication between devices, providing reliable data delivery, flow control, and error correction.
5. **Session Layer (OSI Layer 5)**:
    - Establishes, manages, and terminates connections between devices, handling session setup, maintenance, and teardown.
6. **Presentation Layer (OSI Layer 6)**:
    - Data representation and encryption, ensuring that data is in a format that the application layer can understand.
7. **Application Layer (OSI Layer 7)**:
    - Provides network services directly to end-users and applications, handling high-level protocols and data formatting.
