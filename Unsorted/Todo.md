	- An api to tell the weather. ðŸ‘€

- Redo my github page ðŸ‘€

- AWS course done ðŸ‘€
- Roadmap done ðŸ‘€
- ES6 done ðŸ‘€

- Build a tree roadmap tree
	- can edit and put knowledge on. It is like a note-taking system. Remember the tree we drew when we were little ðŸ‘€
	
- A book reading and taking notes system
	- following `How to read a book` pattern. We scrawl public book sources online, and automatically generate the outline and summarize the book's content. Maybe we should use AI here haha.

- A tool to learning language through conversation. 
	- Haven't played the game yet. Maybe we will have new ideas after playing the game.

	- I don't know what to write, but let's do it.


- Plugin to identify which table the acronym refers to in BQ
- Plugin to prompt if a certain package is deprecated

suppress screenshot
- how to detect the screenshots

Maybe a page being the source truth of the world news / events happening everyday (timeline maybe), being updated everyday. All I need is just to check one page. With an AI tool to summarize, I can easily capture the world events. And it would be better:
- Analyze where I get stuck in trying understanding the events.
- Tracing back to history or some unchanged rules in world to help me understand.


How does this interaction work?
